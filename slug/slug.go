// Page titles should be short and concise because search engines read no more than 55 to 60 characters, including spaces.

// The bottom line is that you want to condense the essence of your content into roughly three to five words and try to use a max of 60 characters.
// Use hyphens
// Use lowercase letters
// Use a max of two path folds per URL
// First of all, you should definitely still include keywords in your URL. According to Brian Dean of Backlinko and John Lincoln, CEO of Ignite Visibility, you should aim for one or two keywords per URL.
// If you feel like you need to include a stop word for your URL to make sense and more readable then go ahead and include it. If it makes it easier for people to read, then thatâ€™s usually your best option.
